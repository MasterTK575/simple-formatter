# simple-formatter
This is a simple arithmetic formatter, based on the project by freecodecamp
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter

Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

What I've learned:
1. How to concatenate strings, how to use the \n 
2. Iterating through lists to create a string as an output
3. How to use return for functions
